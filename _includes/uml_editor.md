## UML Editor

[Github commit tracker](/images/git.png)

This project is a work in progress as part of the Millersville Computer Science Software Development Course. This project is a UML diagram editor that allows the user to construct complex class relationships using a CLI and GUI. Our team is made up of 6 students and we are encouraged to pair up on issues and practice Peer Programming. The class is built up of 4 sprints with User Stories dictating what should happen in a sprint. We have elected to use Java as our language with Maven as the package manager. The GUI uses JavaFX. Since this is an ongoing project I have chosen to not include code snippets or screenshots. **Code is available upon request.**
