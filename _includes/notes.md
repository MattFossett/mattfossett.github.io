## Notes

This is a website created to store class notes taken. A friend of mine is taking some of these classes remotely and asked me to record lecture audio, so I thought a nice way to provide this for him is to host it along side my own notes so that he has a better chance at following the audio. Notes are created using Github's Markdown and are able to be pushed quickly after class.
