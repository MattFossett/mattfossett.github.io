This is a website created to store class notes taken. A friend of mine is taking some of these classes remotely and asked me to record lecture audio, so I thought a nice way to provide this for him is to host it along with my own notes so that he has a better chance at following the audio. Notes are created using Github's Markdown and are able to be pushed quickly after class. 
One problem I quickly found with this method is that before a class started, I would have to make a new markdown file to be "included" in the class main page. I would then have to update the class page to import this file, and then lastly update its links at the top of the class page. I decided to automate this process with the following script.
